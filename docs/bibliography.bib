% provided by most web sites that allow you to export citations. The string
% "article-key" is a citation key, and if you were citing the source in a

A handful of citations here were found in the sources of this paper, but the majority were found elsewhere. This source will be used to discuss what research has already been done in this topic, and to focus on expanding on what has been accomplished already. While other Independent Studies have looked into similar topics, this one is by far the most notable.}

	abstract = {From the Publisher:This is undoubtedly the most accessible book on digital signal processing (DSP) available to the beginner. Using intuitive explanations and well-chosen examples, this book gives you the tools to develop a fundamental understanding of DSP theory. The author covers the essential mathematics by explaining the meaning and significance of the key DSP equations. Comprehensive in scope, and gentle in approach, the book will help you achieve a thorough grasp of the basics and move gradually to more sophisticated DSP concepts and applications.},
	annote = {This textbook is included to understand various data structures necessary to handle digital audio. Lyons discusses various techniques to program with digital signals, and uses examples to provide understanding of the theory behind them. While this source will primarily be used for theory, it will still be useful to fill in gaps in knowledge with programming should any issues arise in development. It will also be used to discuss various programming techniques in writing, but will be supplemented by the Pirkle textbooks as well in those sections.}

	annote  = {This is the second edition of the aformentioned textbook discussing synthesizer development in C++. Unlike the first edition, this one begins by focusing on particular C++ objects and strucutres under the pseudonym "SynthLab". These data structures are provided by the author alongside the textbook in order to understand how a virtual synthesizer is made without the aid of any particular APIs. That being said, the author does note that these can be used in any sort of project that uses APIs such as VST3, Juce, IPlug2, and others. This is potentially one area of research my IS can focus on, which is what benefits or drawbacks there are by using one particular data structure versus another mentioned by Pirkle.}

I am purposfully including both editions released as this edition seems to include more basic information on synthesizers, which is important to understand their functionality and how to use them. This source will be used to assist in the development of my program as it is extremely relevant to my Independent Study.}

This source will be used to provide greater context to how the synthesizer was developed, which will be a short (albeit necessary) tangent in order to understand why the synthesizer is important to many musicians.}
